## Advanced working with functions
1. **Recursion**
- a recursively-defined data structure is a data structure that can be defined by using itself, e.g. HTML tree where every branch can have other branches
2. **Rest parameters and spread syntax**
- `...` at the end of function call represents `rest parameters`
- `...` in a function call is called `spread syntax` and it expands an array into a list
