## Fundamentals
1. **Hello, world!**
    - `<script>` tag
    - js code inside html or in separate files
    - showed an alert
2. **Code structure**
    - `;` separates statements
    - `newline` usually implies `;`, so `;` is not needed
    - add single line comments `//` and multiline comments `/* */`
    - nested comments are not supported
3. **use strict**
    - `"use strict;"` placed at the beginning of a file or function
    - introduced to enable developers to write js the "modern way", with stricter rules and parsing
    - classes and modules use by default strict mode
    - in console strict mode is disabled by default, use `shift + enter` to input multiple lines
4. **Variables**
    - `let`, `var`, `const`
    - `$` and `_` can be used in variable names
