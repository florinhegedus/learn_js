## Fundamentals
1. **Hello, world!**
    - `<script>` tag
    - js code inside html or in separate files
    - showed an alert
2. **Code structure**
    - `;` separates statements
    - `newline` usually implies `;`, so `;` is not needed
    - add single line comments `//` and multiline comments `/* */`
    - nested comments are not supported
